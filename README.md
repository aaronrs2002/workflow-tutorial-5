#Implementing "Task Status"


A project has many steps, each step has many tasks, each task is either "waiting", "in progress", "ready for review" or "complete". By completing all the tasks in a step, that step is complete. By completing all the steps, the project is complete.

In future lessons I plan on adding a "message board."
